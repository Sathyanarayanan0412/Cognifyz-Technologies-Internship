This project aims to provide an in-depth analysis of restaurant data using various data science techniques, including descriptive analysis, geospatial analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling. The analysis is divided into multiple levels, each with specific tasks. This README file outlines the tasks and methodologies used to achieve the objectives.

Level 1
Task 1: Descriptive Analysis
Objective: Calculate basic statistical measures and explore categorical variables.

Numerical Analysis:
Calculate mean, median, standard deviation, and other statistical measures for numerical columns.
Categorical Analysis:
Explore the distribution of categorical variables such as "Country Code," "City," and "Cuisines."
Identify the top cuisines and cities with the highest number of restaurants.
Task 2: Geospatial Analysis
Objective: Visualize and analyze the geospatial distribution of restaurants.

Map Visualization:
Plot the locations of restaurants on a map using latitude and longitude information.
Distribution Analysis:
Analyze the distribution of restaurants across different cities or countries.
Determine if there is any correlation between the restaurant's location and its rating.
Task 3: Table Booking and Online Delivery
Objective: Analyze the availability and impact of table booking and online delivery services.

Service Availability:
Determine the percentage of restaurants that offer table booking and online delivery.
Rating Comparison:
Compare the average ratings of restaurants with table booking and those without.
Delivery Analysis:
Analyze the availability of online delivery among restaurants with different price ranges.
Level 2
Task 1: Price Range Analysis
Objective: Analyze the impact of price range on restaurant ratings.

Common Price Range:
Determine the most common price range among all the restaurants.
Rating Analysis:
Calculate the average rating for each price range.
Identify the color that represents the highest average rating among different price ranges.
Task 2: Feature Engineering
Objective: Create additional features to enhance the dataset.

Feature Extraction:
Extract additional features from existing columns, such as the length of the restaurant name or address.
Feature Creation:
Create new features like "Has Table Booking" or "Has Online Delivery" by encoding categorical variables.
Task 3: Predictive Modeling
Objective: Build a regression model to predict restaurant ratings.

Model Building:
Build a regression model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on available features.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
Experiment with different algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forest) and compare their performance.
Level 3
Task 1: Customer Preference Analysis
Objective: Analyze customer preferences based on cuisine type and ratings.

Cuisine Analysis:
Analyze the relationship between the type of cuisine and the restaurant's rating.
Identify the most popular cuisines among customers based on the number of votes.
Determine if there are any specific cuisines that tend to receive higher ratings.
Task 2: Data Visualization
Objective: Create visual representations of the data to gain insights.

Distribution Visualization:
Create visualizations to represent the distribution of ratings using different charts (histogram, bar plot, etc.).
Comparison Visualization:
Compare the average ratings of different cuisines or cities using appropriate visualizations.
Feature Relationship Visualization:
Visualize the relationship between various features and the target variable to gain insights.
